                            <p>
                                It was 2008 when my best friend, and now Co-Owner Luis and I met in our 4th grade class.
                                From there our friendship has grown into what is now City Processing Units.
                                Throughout high school we took iT classes that gave us a majority of our current
                                computer
                                knowledge.
                                We learned about PC parts, how to build PCs, networking and security protocols within
                                the
                                digital age.


                                During our time in high school we participated in a program called Virginia STAR / SWAT.
                                In this program we rebuilt old computers and went to schools where we gave away free PCs
                                to
                                families in need.
                                For me, this is really what compelled me to get into PCs deeply.


                                Fast-forward a few years to April of 2019, when I finally built my first PC for myself.
                                After this, Luis built his shortly after and I just had to help him.
                                I turned from a guy who built his own PC to guy who was passionate about everything
                                related
                                to computers.
                                We began talking about starting a business for over a year and trying to figure out what
                                we
                                could do.


                                June 25, 2020 our dreams and aspirations came to fruition. City Processing Units was
                                finally
                                online and we began our journey into growing our brand.


                                Our main goal is to provide our clients with the best products, service, and prices
                                available.

                                that
                                we give you the best that money can buy.
